# ShinyDEA

A Shiny app for implementing DEA models
- Access the ShinyDEA app here: https://dhbang.shinyapps.io/ShinyDEA/

This app enables easy implementation of fundamental Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models, including CCR, BCC, the slack-based model (SBM), and the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI).
Future updates will include extended models such as the Two-stage Network DEA, Multi-stage Network DEA, Network DEA with shared-inputs, and alternative Malmquist models.
